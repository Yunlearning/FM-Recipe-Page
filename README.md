## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   CSS Grid for responsive layouts
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library for dynamic components
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework for seamless development
-   [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first framework with custom theming

### What I learned

I worked on this project using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, primarily relying on CSS Grid as the main layout approach. This project taught me a great deal, such as how to customize Tailwind CSS's default theme through its theme configuration and how to leverage CSS Grid to design component layouts and manage breakpoints effectively.

### Continued development

I hope to continue focusing on using CSS Grid and Tailwind CSS to build responsive layouts, as well as using Next.js and React to build dynamic components in future projects.
